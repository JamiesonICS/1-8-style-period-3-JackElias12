        <h3 id="prefix">Written from the perspective of Jack Elias</h3>
        
       <p> In the late 70’s, high school friends Anthony Keidis, Flea, Hillel Slovak (guitarist), and Jack Irons (drummer) created Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The group worked their way into the early 70’s LA punk scene from which they heavily took influences from.  They created a stable underground fanbase in the city of angels and were remembered then as the band with very meticulously worn tube socks. They would then change names, becoming the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1983. Success found the group with their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan in 1987, but shortly after Hillel Slovak would die of a heroin overdose and drummer Jack Irons  left the band. </p>
        
       <p>This is where the lineup that would go on to become the true Red Hot chili Peppers would be formed, with John Frusciante and Chad Smith joining the band. The newly formed quartet would then release Mother’s Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, both massive hits, including a top ten single with “Under the Bridge” and grammy winner “Give it Away”. Hit after hit and after album the Chili Peppers would cement themselves as not only a popular rock band, but a band for the ages. Their next three albums all went platinum multiple times worldwide including more top one hits such as “By the Way”, “Snow(Hey Oh)”, “Californication” and “Dani California”.</p>

       <p>In 2008, Frusicante announced his departure from the band to pursue a solo career. He was replaced quickly by guitarist Josh Klinghoffer who would record three studio albums and play live with the band for eleven years. Frusicante would then return with the band and record two albums that both released in 2022, “Unlimited Love” and “Return of the Dream Canteen”.</p>

       <p>To date the Red Hot Chili Peppers have played 1924 shows on record over the course of twenty-two years starting in 1982 all the way to 2024. The average age of the band currently is around 59. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and are widely regarded as one of the greatest funk-rock bands of all time.</p>
